### Abstract

Cryptographic hash functions is one of the main component of the modern cryptography, which has practical applications in providing message integrity, authentication, digital signatures and various others securities.

SIGTACS is oragnizing a lecture series on the Cryptographic hash functions which will cover the following topics.
- Introduction to cryptographic hash function
- Merkle-Damgard Construction
- MD5 hash function and its cryptanalysis
- Sponge Construction
- KECCAK hash function
- Preimage attacks on KECCAK (will cover our recent paper)
- Collision attacks on KECCAK
- Introduction to BLAKE hash function
