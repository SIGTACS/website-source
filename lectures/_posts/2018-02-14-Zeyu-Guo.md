### Abstract

The following is the tentative syllabus. I will often follow Salil Vadhan's survey but not always.

- Basic stuff: example of randomized algorithms. Probabilistic method. Derandomization by conditional expectations. Tail bounds. Pairwise and k-wise independence.
- Epsilon-biased space and almost k-wise independence
- Expander graphs. The combinatorial construction of expander graphs via Zigzag product
- SL=L
- Hardness vs. randomness: Nisan-Wigderson generator.
- List-decodable codes and its application to hardness vs. randomness (hardness amplification)
- (Seeded) extractors
