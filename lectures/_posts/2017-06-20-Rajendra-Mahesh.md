### Abstract

In this course, we will consider mathematical objects known as lattices. More recently, lattices have become a topic of active research in computer science. They are used as an algorithmic tool to solve a wide variety of problems, they have many applications in cryptography and cryptanalysis and they have some unique properties from a computational complexity point of view. Classes will commence on 29th May. These are the topics that will be covered in the next 2 weeks.

- Introduction to Lattices
- LLL algorithm
- Cryptanalysis of RSA and Knapsack Cryptosystem using LLL
