## Abstract

Matroids are abstract structures which generalize the notion of linear independence in vector spaces. This lead to surprising connections to graph theory, combinatorial optimization, and topology. In this talk, we would introduce the idea of matroids in simple words, look at the idea of matroid intersection, and a greedy algorithm for finding it.
Outline/reference: <https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/69287>
The talk will be accessible to someone with knowledge of linear algebra, matrices, and basic graph algorithms (e.g., DFS, BFS, Kruskal’s/Prim’s minimum spanning tree algorithms).
