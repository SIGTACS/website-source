### Abstract

Recently Hao Huang proved the famous "Sensitivity Conjecture", one of the main conjectures about Boolean functions open for last 30 years. Surprisingly, the proof is pretty simple and requires not more than 2 pages to explain completely. I will present preliminaries, context and proof of the conjecture in this talk.
