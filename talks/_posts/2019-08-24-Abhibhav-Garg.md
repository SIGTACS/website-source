## Abstract

The proof of the Kneser conjecture by Lovasz in 1978 gave rise to the field of topological combinatorics: applying topological and algebraic topological methods to combinatorial problems. In this talk, I will present some simple applications of the Borsuk Ulam theorem to discrete problems.
