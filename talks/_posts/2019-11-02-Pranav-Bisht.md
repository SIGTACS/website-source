## Abstract

In this talk, we will define the ABP (Algebraic branching program) model of computation, followed by non-commutative and read once oblivious ABPs (ROABPs). Nisan [Nis91] gave an exact characterization to determine the size and width of non commutative ABPs which will be the highlight of this talk . We will also derive the same characterization in the language of ROABPs.
