## Abstract

We consider the univariate polynomial $f_d := (x + 1)^d$ when represented as a sum of constant-powers of univariate polynomials. We define a natural measure for the model, the support-union, and conjecture that it is $\Omega(d)$ for $f_d$ . 

We show a stunning connection of the conjecture to the two main problems in algebraic complexity: Polynomial Identity Testing (PIT) and VP vs. VNP. Our conjecture on f_d implies blackbox-PIT in P. Assuming the Generalized Riemann Hypothesis (GRH), it also implies VP $\neq$ VNP. No such connection to PIT, from lower bounds on constant-powers representation of polynomials was known before. We establish that studying the expression of $(x + 1)^d$ , as the sum of 25th-powers of univariates, suffices to solve the two major open questions. 

This is based on joint work (submitted) with Prof.  Nitin Saxena (IIT Kanpur) and Prof. Thomas Thierauf (Aalen University); see the paper for details: [TR20-039](https://eccc.weizmann.ac.il/report/2020/039/)
