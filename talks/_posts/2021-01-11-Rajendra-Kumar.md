## Abstract

The recent advances in the design and construction of quantum computers require us to design the cryptosystem secure even after quantum computers. Most of the current day cryptosystem's security is dependent on the hardness of integer factoring or discrete log problem. Both these are polynomial-time solvable by a quantum computer [Shor, FOCS, 1994]. The quantum resistance and many other lattices' unique properties make lattice-based cryptosystem the most popular candidate for post-quantum cryptography.

In this talk, we will present a number of exponential time reductions between the Shortest Vector Problem and the Closest Vector Problem over lattices in different â„“p norms (SVPp and CVPp respectively). We will also discuss how theses reductions are useful for the fine grained hardness of the lattice problems.

This is a joint work with Divesh Aggarwal, Yanlin Chen, Zeyong Li and Noah Stephens-Davidowitz.
