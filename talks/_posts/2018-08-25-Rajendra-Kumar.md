### Abstract

In this talk,we will focus on two fundamental problems in Lattice Theory, First one is Shortest Vector Problem (SVP) where we find shortest non-zero vector in Lattice. The other one is Closet Vector Problem (CVP) where we find closet Lattice point of a given vector. These problems have applications in Integer Factorization, post-Quantum Cryptography. Security of the lattice-based cryptosystem is based on the hardness of these problems. We will show that both the problems are NP-hard within some constant approximation factor.

No prior knowledge related to lattice is required.
