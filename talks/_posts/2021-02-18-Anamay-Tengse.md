## Abstract

In view of the lack of strong lower bounds in most branches of complexity theory, some of the research has focused on whether the known approaches can ever lead to strong enough results. In the case of Boolean circuits, Razborov and Rudich (1995) observed that most of the then known lower bounds could be proven using a certain template, which they called the 'natural proofs' framework. They further showed that if strong enough One-Way-Functions exist, then no natural proof can lead to a super-polynomial lower bound against Boolean circuits!

Recently, Forbes, Shpilka and Volk (2018) and Grochow, Kumar, Saks and Saraf (2017) independently came up with an algebraic analogue of the natural proofs framework: algebraic or (algebraically) natural proofs. A bit like the Boolean case, both these works show that the existence of algebraic natural proofs for poly-sized algebraic circuits (called VP) directly contradicts a derandomisation assumption about algebraic circuits. However, this assumption is quite non-standard and it is therefore difficult to form any strong opinion about it.

In a recent joint work with Mrinal Kumar (IITB), C. Ramya (TIFR) and Ramprasad Satharishi (TIFR), we show that if there is an exponential separation between the classes VNP (algebraic NP) and VP (algebraic P), then there are no algebraic natural proofs for the class VNP. This is perhaps the only known result about the existence of algebraic natural proofs that follows from standard hardness assumptions. Moreover, this statement also has some interesting consequences for the efficacy of 'natural lower bound techniques' in the algebraic world.

In this talk, we will first get to know the framework of algebraic natural proofs, and then discuss our result and its consequences. After that, if the time permits, we will briefly go over the main ideas behind our proof.
