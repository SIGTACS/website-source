## Abstract

Today, datasets (such as social-networks) have become prohibitively large to store on a single system. The streaming setting models this problem. Here, an algorithm works a small memory (typically, logarithmic in size of the input) and solves the problem by repeatedly traversing the input. In this talk, we introduce the communication problem, where two or more systems have to jointly perform a task that neither can finish individually. We look at several communication problems and surprisingly find that they can be used to study the “hardness” of problems in the streaming setting.

This talk would be interesting for students with interest in algorithms and probability. It would be helpful for those working in other areas, who would like to explore streaming and/or communication complexity. Finally, many references to the latest research would be useful for those working in these fields.

The talk will be accessible through high-school level math, and yet, will introduce interesting ideas from probability theory, information theory, and communication complexity. At the end of the talk, we will provide a comprehensive list of references for further reading.
