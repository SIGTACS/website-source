## Abstract

Unambiguous computation is a restriction of nondeterministic computation where the nondeterministic machine has at most one accepting computation path on each input.  In logspace computation these classes are know as NL and UL.  An important question is whether these classes are equal or not. This question is equivalent to asking whether the reachability in directed graphs can be solved in UL or not. In this talk I will present a result which showed that reachability in O(log n) genus directed graphs can be solved in UL.
