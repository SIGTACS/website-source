## Abstract

Hilbert's Nullstellensatz is an important theorem in Commutative Algebra and Algebraic Geometry. It connects the notion of ideals (in Commutative Algebra) to that of varieties (in Algebraic Geometry). In this project, we investigate the computational version of this problem (HN) which basically translates to finding how hard is it to decide whether or not 1 lies in the ideal generated by a set of polynomials, say {f1, f2, ..., fm} in k[x1, x2, ..., xn]. In particular, we look at the two most important results pertaining to the complexity of the above problem (for field k of zero-characteristic): HN is in PSPACE, and under Generalized Riemann Hypothesis, HN is in AM.
