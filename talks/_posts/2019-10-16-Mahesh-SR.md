## Abstract

A randomness extractor is a function that outputs almost uniform bits from a weakly random entropy source. The Leftover Hash Lemma (LHL) states that universal hash functions are good randomness extractors. LHL leads to simple and efficient extractors and hence has applications in many areas of cryptography and complexity theory.

In this talk, the speaker will give a short description of extractors, discuss the proof for LHL and give a simple application of LHL.
