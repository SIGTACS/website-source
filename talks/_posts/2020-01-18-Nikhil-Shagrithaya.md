## Abstract

The tensor product GxH of two graphs G and H has the vertex set V(G)xV(H), and the pairs (g,h) and (g`,h`) are adjacent if and only if g is adjacent to g` in G and h is adjacent to h` in H. A proper colouring g -> C(g) for graph G can be 'lifted' to give a proper colouring (g,h) -> C(g) for GxH, and similarly a lifting can be done for a proper colouring of H as well. This implies that the minimum between the chromatic numbers of G and H forms an upper bound on the chromatic number of GxH (i.e, X(GxH) \leq min(X(G), X(H)). In 1966, S. Hedetniemi conjectured that equality holds for all finite simple graphs. In 2019, Yaroslav Shitov refuted the conjecture by constructing a counterexample using the concept of exponential graphs, which have vertices corresponding to every possible c-colouring of an n-vertex graph, with two vertices being adjacent only if the corresponding colourings paint every adjacent vertex with different colours.

In this talk, we will discuss exponential graphs in detail, and then look at the construction of the counterexample.
