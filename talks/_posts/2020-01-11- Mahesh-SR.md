## Abstract

Cryptographic hash functions are widely used in modern cryptography such as in digital signatures, message integrity and authentication. The U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) announced the “NIST hash function competition” for the Secure Hash Algorithm-3 (SHA-3) in 2006. They received 64 proposals from around the world. Among these, KECCAK designed by Bertoni, Daemen, Peeters, and Van Assche became one of the candidates for SHA-3. It won the competition in October 2012 and was standardized as a “Secure Hash Algorithm 3” .

In this talk, we will look at new preimage attacks on KECCAK-384 and KECCAK-512 for 2, 3 and 4 rounds. The attacks are based on non-linear structures (structures that contain quadratic terms). These structures were studied by Guo et al. and Li et al. to give preimage attacks on round reduced KECCAK. We carefully construct non-linear structures such that the quadratic terms are not spread across the whole state. This allows us to create more linear equations between the variables and hash values, leading to better preimage attacks. As a result, we get the best theoretical preimage attack on KECCAK-384 and KECCAK-512 for 2 and 3-rounds and also KECCAK-384 for 4-rounds.
