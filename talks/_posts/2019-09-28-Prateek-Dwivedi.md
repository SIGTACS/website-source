## Abstract

The approximation closure of a class of polynomials A is another class of polynomials which can approximate the polynomials of A in an appropriate sense. Motivated from the problem of checking separation of these classes, recently a class of small-width algebraic branching programs (ABP) and its approximation closure were studied. In this talk, we will discuss some of those central findings.

In the first half of the talk, we will set the prelude by discussing briefly on introduction to arithmetic circuits, algebraic branching program (ABP) and some popular algebraic complexity classes like VF, VBP and their approximation closures. In the latter half, we will discuss how the introduced classes are related to each other and with their approximation closure. And if time permits, we can also look into Fibonacci polynomials, Fibonacci complexity and Border Fibonacci complexity of polynomials.
